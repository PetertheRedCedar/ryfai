# Reclaim Your Freedom AI (RYFAI)

Im Peter, the original writer of this program
This is a program written in mostly Python that brings useful open-source AI to your fingertips.

Are you tired of corporate giants stealing your data when using their products? Well, look no further than RYFAI. We are a project that tries to combat this
by utilizing the power of small but punchy and powerful AI models. The models we provide are like ChatGPT, and also completely open source models.

You can use this program offline as well, ensuring that NO data is being collected about your conversations with the AI models. 

That being said, I encourage you to give this program a good reputation.

Heres how to set up:
1. run 'setup.py'
2. run 'pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu11z streamlit ollama easygui diffusers' **If you have a CUDA capable GPU**. If you do not, run 'pip install torch torchvision torchaudio easygui streamlit diffusers ollama' the normal way.
3. Developers, feel free to create a new issue at the top left if you run into issues or have requests.

# For non-developers
1. Click 'releases' (right side of the screen)
2. At the top should be the newest version of the software. Click 'assets' dropdown, select the executable file that is right for your operating system, download it
3. Extract the zip file.
4. Double-click setup.exe (or setup.AppImage on Linux)
5. enjoy private AI chatting!
