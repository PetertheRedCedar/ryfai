# Reclaim Your Freedom AI (RYFAI)

Im Peter, the original writer of this program. You can donate to my Venmo if you please, it helps me keep these projects alive!
This is a program written in mostly Python that brings useful open-source AI to your fingertips.

Are you tired of corporate giants stealing your data when using their products? Well, look no further than RYFAI. We are a project that tries to combat this
by utilizing the power of small but punchy and powerful AI models. The models we provide are like ChatGPT, and also completely open source models.

You can use this program offline as well, ensuring that NO data is being collected about your conversations with the AI models. 

That being said, I encourage you to give this program a good reputation.

Heres how to set up.

# For developers:

For now, this project will remain closed source for now, but if you are interested in being a part of the developer team, email 'ryfai@proton.me'
This project is in python (mostly), with a little bash/batch script.
